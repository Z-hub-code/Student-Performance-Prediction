# Student Performance Prediction

Predicts students’ final grades using **ML models** based on demographics, study habits, and school factors.

## Overview
- **Goal:** Predict final grade (G3) using historical student data  
- **Dataset:** UCI Student Performance Repository  
- **Features:** Age, gender, study time, failures, absences, prior grades (G1, G2)  

## Workflow
1. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Handle missing values & duplicates  
   - Encode categorical features  
   - Scale numerical features  

2. **Modeling**  
   - Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest  
   - Evaluation: **MSE**, **R² Score**  
   - Random Forest chosen for best performance  

3. **Feature Analysis**  
   - Identify top factors influencing student performance  

4. **Deployment**  
   - Save trained model & scaler  
   - Reusable pipeline for new predictions  

## Benefits
- Identify at-risk students early  
- Insights for personalized interventions  
- Foundation for ML & education analytics projects  

## Project Structure

## How to Run
1. Open notebook in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)
